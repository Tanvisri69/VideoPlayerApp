# Weather App (In Progress)

Welcome to my Android Weather App project! This application is designed to provide users with real-time weather updates by integrating with a reliable weather API. Built using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Retrofit**, and **MVVM architecture**, it also includes **location services** to auto-detect user location for accurate forecasts.

> 🚧 This project is currently under development. Code and documentation will be added shortly.
